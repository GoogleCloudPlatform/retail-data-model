# Examples

## Introduction

The examples ARE NOT intended to be an exhaustive set of use-cases,
nor are they intended to be an implementation of the API. 
Rather the intention of the examples is to demonstrate how
the API can be used in an implementation, and more over
as a reference for Retail Data Model implementations.

## All Examples

All example (Go, Java, Python) execute three primary patterns:

1) How to use enumerations.
2) How to create domain model objects.
3) How to create a server / end-point, and send and receive requests as a client and server.

These specific demonstration represent the intentions of the API,
while each implementation provides data centric contracts
for the storage medium (e.g. database, or file store), 
and the service implementation for accessing the data.

Lastly, these models are provided as a way to build and efficient
ecosystem on top of RDM, this includes services and third-party integrations.
