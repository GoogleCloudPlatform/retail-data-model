/*
 * A type of CustomerAccount used to accumulate purchases and other activity
 * that determines if a customer is eligible to receive a rebate.  Retailers may
 * establish incentive programs that track customer purchases over a designated
 * period of time (e.g annual, quarterly, etc.) and based on meeting minimum
 * cumulative quantity and/or monetary value, issue a rebate. This is a common
 * incentive used in membership based retailers that require customers to pay a
 * fee to join.  The programs may be tiered based on membership level (which
 * varies based on periodic fees to join).  Typically this kind of program
 * stipulates that a customer must buy some minimum value of items over a
 * designated period of time to receive a rebate that is calculated as a
 * percentage of the total purchase value.  In this scenario, the
 * CustomerRebateAccount is the "container" used to accumulate the period sum of
 * purchases. The rebate cumulative values are reset at the end of the
 * designated rebate period (e.g. a year). As noted, this is commonly used in
 * membership based programs and the rebate period is synchronized with the
 * membership period (usually a year).

 *
 * Typically a rebate claim for a consumer is accompanied by the UPC from the
 * product package, a copy of the retailer receipt and customer contact data
 * (for check mailing purposes).
 *
 * Typically a retailer will not capture a customer-prepared rebate claim. That
 * should be acceptable since a vendor-paid and processed rebate lies outside
 * the retailer's accounting and financial reporting scope.  Instant rebates
 * that involve the payment of tender to a customer by the retailer requires a
 * claim to connect the retailer-sponsor billback, discount (or whatever vehicle
 * used to recognize the vendor liability and expense) to a rebate program and
 * retail transaction.
 */
message CustomerRebateClaim {}

/*
 * A type of CustomerRewardLineItem used to record the earning, redemption and
 * adjustment of REBATES. CUSTOMER REBATES are rewards that a customer earns and
 * may claim after a purchase is completed. Customer rebates may be INSTANT
 * REBATES or DEFERRABLE REBATES.
 *
 * Instant rebates are earned and redeemed within the same transaction.
 * The earning part of an instant rebate is represented by an earn activity code
 * in the parent CustomerRewardLineItem. Instant rebates are subtracted from a
 * purchase price after it is recorded. The rebate value is represented by a
 * redemption/settlement CustomerRewardLineItem.
 *
 * An INSTANT REBATE always has two CustomerRewardLineItem and
 * CustomerRewardRebateLineItem instances for any rebate captured as part of a
 * retail transaction.  The first covers the earning of the rebate (which is a
 * rebate claim).  The second is a rebate redemption/settlement which is the
 * payment of the rebate value to the customer.  To the customer instant rebates
 * are nearly indistinguishable from a discount.  Within the ARTS ODM instant
 * rebates and discounts are very different concepts (see the ODM Narrative
 * Section: Understanding Rebates for a detailed explanation).
 *
 * Customer Rebates may be DEFERRABLE rewards.  This means that a rebate is
 * earned in a transaction, added to a rebate payable balance and paid to the
 * customer at a future time through a separate transaction.
 *
 * Deferrable rebates will be recorded as two CustomerRewardLineItem -
 * CustomerRewardRebateLineItem entity type instances.  The first captures the
 * earning of a rebate.  The second captures the posting of the liability
 * established for the future return of the rebate value to the customer.

/*

 * their records.

 * Electric utilities
 * Automobile manufacturers
